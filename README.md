Countries Info
===================

Countries info is a collection of some useful information for every country in the [**ISO 3166**][1] standard.

----------

## A few words about ISO 3166

ISO 3166 has three parts: *codes for countries*, *codes for subdivisions* and *formerly used codes* (codes that were once used to describe countries but are no longer in use).

### ISO 3166-1

Describes the country codes and contains the following information:

 * a two-letter code (alpha-2) which is recommended as the general purpose code,
 * a three-letter code (alpha-3) which is more closely related to the country name and
 * a three digit numeric code (numeric-3) which can be useful if you need to avoid using Latin script.
